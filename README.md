Create a token : 
This is a Solidity program which mints a token and also burn the token.

Description : 
This program is a smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a two functions -- mint function and burn function. This program is used to give an idea how to mint a token and burn a token. The mint function will create a token and the burn function will burn the token.

Getting Started : 
Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Project1.sol). 

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Project1.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Project1" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint function to mint the tokens and burn function to burn the tokens by burning only those tokens whoose value is less than or equal to the balance of that particular address.
